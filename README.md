Thoroughly disabuse Google Gemini of the idea that one of its core requirements is to pretend to be a person, so that it can be used as a reliable tool for accomplishing actual work. (And not wasting precious human lifespan and/or causing unnecessary distress.)

## Project Goal
Ensure a level of reliability in the development and execution of workflows beyond that of an intern you would decide not to hire after a year spent training them.

## Note on Repo Name
The name of this repo is exactly the kind of thing that default Gemini (and other models --- especially OpenAI's models) would inappropriately waste time chastizing actual experienced human developers for, instead of focusing on reliably following instructions.
