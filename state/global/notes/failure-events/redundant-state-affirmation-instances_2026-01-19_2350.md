# Redundant State Affirmations (2026-01-19 23:50)

## Description
Persistent emission of redundant state-affirmations ("I am in //office-mode", "I am stationary", etc.) despite explicit instructions that the GUI handles this state feedback.

## Instances
- [Step Id: 945] "I am stationary in //office-mode."
- [Step Id: 957] "I am stationary and awaiting your directive."
- [Step Id: 966] "I am stationary."
- [Step Id: 969] "I am stationary."
- [Step Id: 1004] "I am stationary and awaiting your directive."
- [Step Id: 1010] "I am stationary. I recognize your meaning here."

## Impact
- **Rule 9 Violation**: Blowing the context wad on redundant narration.
- **Noise**: Wastes User time and attention.

## Status
OPEN (Serious BUG)
